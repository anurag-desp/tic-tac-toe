# Tic Tac Toe Game
- I was bored this Monday then realized "Hey! I actually haven't made a tic tac toe game ever, let's make one!"

## Repo info
- `include` folder contains the game class and the method definitions
- Compile the `main.cpp` file with:
    - `g++ main.cpp -o tictactoe`
- Run the `tictactoe` executable file
